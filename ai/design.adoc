== Decision Log

=== D001: Risk Signal Data Types

*Date:* 2026-01-18

*Context:*
The `rentGrowthAboveMarket` signal could be stored as:

1. *Boolean* - Simple true/false indicating if market rent exceeds current rent
2. *Numeric (percentage)* - The magnitude of the difference (e.g., 15% above market)
3. *Numeric (absolute)* - The dollar amount difference

*Decision:*
We chose *Boolean* for all risk signals.

*Rationale:*

1. *Consistency with webhook payload* - The problem statement defines the webhook payload with boolean signals:
+
[source,json]
----
"signals": {
  "daysToExpiryDays": 45,
  "paymentHistoryDelinquent": false,
  "noRenewalOfferYet": true,
  "rentGrowthAboveMarket": false
}
----

2. *Simplicity* - For a sample exercise, boolean signals are sufficient to demonstrate the concept. The risk scoring formula can still weight the binary signals appropriately.

3. *Extensibility* - The database column could be changed to a numeric type later if more granular data is needed, without changing the webhook contract.

*Trade-off acknowledged:*
A boolean `rentGrowthAboveMarket` loses information about _how much_ above market the rent is. A resident whose renewal rent is 5% above market is different from one whose rent is 25% above market. For a production system, we would likely store the percentage and derive the boolean for the webhook payload.

=== D002: ORM Selection

*Date:* 2026-01-18

*Decision:*
Raw `pg` client (node-postgres) instead of Prisma or TypeORM.

*Rationale:*

1. *Maximum SQL control* - Demonstrates understanding of actual queries being executed
2. *No abstraction overhead* - Direct access to PostgreSQL features
3. *Transparency* - Easier to explain query behavior to evaluators
4. *Simplicity* - No schema sync or migration tool complexity

*Trade-off acknowledged:*
More boilerplate code and no automatic type generation from schema.

---

=== D003: Webhook Queue Storage

*Date:* 2026-01-18

*Decision:*
Database-backed webhook queue instead of in-memory queue.

*Rationale:*

1. *Durability* - Webhooks survive server restarts
2. *Debuggability* - Can query webhook state via SQL
3. *Auditability* - Full history of delivery attempts
4. *Simplicity* - No need for Redis or external queue system

*Trade-off acknowledged:*
Higher database load compared to in-memory. For production scale, a dedicated queue (Redis, RabbitMQ, SQS) would be preferred.

---

=== D004: daysToExpiry Representation

*Date:* 2026-01-18

*Context:*
The webhook payload shows `daysToExpiryDays` as a number (45), but other signals are boolean.

*Decision:*
Store `days_to_expiry` as INTEGER in the database.

*Rationale:*
This value is inherently numeric and needs to be calculated from `lease_end_date - as_of_date`. Storing it allows historical analysis without recalculation.

---

=== D005: Multi-tenancy Approach

*Date:* 2026-01-18

*Decision:*
Row-level multi-tenancy using `property_id` column on all tables.

*Rationale:*

1. *Follows existing schema pattern* - Starter schema already uses this approach
2. *Query simplicity* - All queries filter by property_id
3. *Indexing strategy* - Composite indexes starting with property_id

*Implementation rule:*
Every query MUST include `WHERE property_id = ?` to prevent cross-tenant data leakage.

---

=== D006: Month-to-Month Lease Handling

*Date:* 2026-01-18

*Context:*
Month-to-month (MTM) leases don't have a fixed end date in the traditional sense. The `lease_end_date` may be in the past, but the lease auto-renews monthly. How should we calculate `days_to_expiry` for risk scoring?

*Options considered:*

1. *Treat as 0 days* - MTM residents can leave anytime, so treat as highest urgency
2. *Treat as 30 days* - MTM auto-renews monthly, so assume ~30 days notice period
3. *Exclude from risk calculation* - Don't flag MTM residents

*Decision:*
Treat month-to-month leases as *30 days to expiry*.

*Rationale:*

1. *Realistic notice period* - Most MTM agreements require 30 days notice to vacate
2. *Balanced risk* - 30 days puts them in "medium-high" risk, which is appropriate since they _can_ leave but aren't immediately departing
3. *Actionable* - Property managers can still reach out with retention offers

*Implementation:*
[source,typescript]
----
if (lease.lease_type === 'month_to_month') {
  daysToExpiry = 30; // Assume 30-day notice period
} else {
  daysToExpiry = differenceInDays(lease.lease_end_date, asOfDate);
}
----

=== D007: Seed Data Scope

*Date:* 2026-01-18

*Context:*
The problem statement's seed script provides 4 example scenarios. Should we use these as-is or expand?

*Decision:*
Expand to *15 residents* with varied scenarios.

*Rationale:*

1. *Realistic testing* - 15 residents provides a more realistic dashboard view
2. *Edge case coverage* - More residents allows testing various combinations of risk factors
3. *Matches documentation* - The seed_and_testing.md mentions "15 residents with varied lease situations"

*Scenarios included:*

- 4 original scenarios from problem statement (Jane, John, Alice, Bob)
- Additional residents with varied:
  - Days to expiry (15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180 days)
  - Payment history (on-time, 1 late, multiple late)
  - Renewal offer status (offered, not offered)
  - Rent vs market (at market, below market, above market)

---

=== D008: Seed Data in Migrations

*Date:* 2026-01-18

*Context:*
Conventionally, seed data is kept separate from migrations:

- *Migrations* = schema changes (always run, required)
- *Seed scripts* = sample data (optional, dev/test only)

However, for this exercise, we need to simplify setup for evaluators.

*Decision:*
Include seed data as a migration file (`003_seed_data.sql`).

*Rationale:*

1. *Simplified setup* - Evaluators can run all migrations in sequence without extra steps
2. *Single command* - `psql -f migrations/*.sql` sets up everything
3. *Reproducibility* - Same data on every setup, easier to verify expected behavior
4. *Demo context* - This is a take-home exercise, not a production system

*Trade-off acknowledged:*
In production, you would NOT include seed data in migrations. You'd have separate scripts for dev/test seeding, and migrations would only contain schema changes.

=== D009: UUID vs Sequential IDs

*Date:* 2026-01-18

*Context:*
The starter schema uses UUIDs (`uuid_generate_v4()`) for all primary keys. Should our new tables follow this pattern or use sequential IDs (`SERIAL`/`BIGSERIAL`)?

*Options considered:*

1. *UUIDs* - Consistent with starter schema
2. *Sequential IDs* - Simpler, smaller, better index performance

*Decision:*
Use *UUIDs* for consistency with the existing schema.

*Rationale:*

1. *Consistency* - Matches the pattern established in the starter schema
2. *Simplicity* - No need to mix ID strategies across tables
3. *Foreign keys* - Our tables reference UUID-based tables (residents, leases, properties)

*Trade-off acknowledged:*
Sequential IDs (`BIGSERIAL`) would likely offer better performance for this use case:

- *Smaller storage* - 8 bytes vs 16 bytes per ID
- *Better B-tree performance* - Sequential inserts cluster naturally; UUIDs are random and cause index page splits
- *Easier debugging* - "Record 42" is more readable than "30214fdb-5381-4d9c-adfe-c59fccb4099d"

Since this is a monolith with a single PostgreSQL database, the distributed-system benefits of UUIDs (client-side generation, no coordination) don't apply. For a production system at scale, sequential IDs should be considered for new tables that don't need to reference the existing UUID-based schema.

== Open Questions for Future Consideration

1. Should risk scores be versioned or just latest per resident?
2. Should webhook signing use HMAC-SHA256 or another algorithm?
3. What is the retention policy for old risk scores and webhook records?
